## Running our Project Two - Team 04 Client and Server
Note: The project has the dependency [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/), using jcommon-1.0.23.jar and jfreechart-1.0.19.jar. Ensure these are added to classpath or modules when compiling.

Run edu.asu.ser516.projecttwo.team04.Main, passing "-init client" or "-init server" to start the application as a client or server, respectively.

Switch between the client and server application without rebooting by typing "init server" or "init client" in the console's input field.
